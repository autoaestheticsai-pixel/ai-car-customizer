# Logo Setup Instructions

## Adding Your AutoAesthetics AI Logo

To complete the branding setup, please follow these steps:

### 1. Add Your Logo Image

- Place your logo image file (`Sleek Minimalistic Logo with Cool Tones.png`) in the `public/` directory
- Rename it to `logo.png` for consistency
- The logo should be optimized for web use (recommended size: 48x48px to 96x96px)

### 2. Logo Requirements

- **Format**: PNG, JPG, or SVG
- **Size**: 48x48px to 96x96px (will be scaled responsively)
- **Background**: Transparent or matches your brand colors
- **Quality**: High resolution for crisp display

### 3. Current Setup

The Logo component is already configured to:

- ✅ Display the logo image from `/public/logo.png`
- ✅ Fall back to "AA" text logo if image fails to load
- ✅ Scale responsively (48x48px base size)
- ✅ Include hover animations
- ✅ Match brand colors (Electric Blue #00AEEF)

### 4. Brand Colors Applied

- **Primary**: Electric Blue (#00AEEF)
- **Secondary**: Metallic Gray (#2E2E2E)
- **Background**: Jet Black (#0A0A0A)
- **Accent**: White/Silver for text highlights

### 5. Testing

Once you add the logo image:

1. Restart the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000`
3. Check that the logo displays correctly in the navbar
4. Verify responsive scaling on different screen sizes

The application is ready and will automatically use your logo once the image file is in place!
